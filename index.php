<hr><b><h1> BIOGRAPHY </h1></b>
<p>
	Hi my name is Rosel Alferez Aliganga. I live in Pangdan,City og Naga,Cebu. Im 19 years old and have four (4) brothers named Ruel,Rusty John,Rodney and Rasheed.

 I live in Pangdan since I was five (5) years old where my father's parents lived. My grandfather at that time was sick and my mother was asked to taked good care
 of him. So that was the reason why we transfer in Pangdan. But sad to say after several weeks my grandfather died. So, my father decided to live in Pangdan permanently  and so my mother.

Before, I was called Kiray becaused I was looked alike of Kiray Celis, even now some of my friends still called me that nickname. I get mad when someone called me that name, I am already 
immuned.
Others, call me "kulot" because of my curly hair and messy hair. My skin color and eyes is brown.

First,I'd like to finish my studies to reach my goals in life and my goals for my family. They're been my inspiration since I was kid but I don't want to follow the way they discipline us,
before
Eventhough,they were like that before I already understand the  reasons why they do that to us. Second, I want to develops my skills in Photography and maybe someday I will create my own
business. 
about photography.
